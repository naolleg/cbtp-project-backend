Infant Immunization Monitoring System (CBTP Project)
Overview
The Infant Immunization Monitoring System is a Community-Based Training Program (CBTP) project that aims to revolutionize the traditional methods of registering and scheduling infants for their post-natal vaccinations. This system digitalizes the information and monitoring processes, providing a more efficient and effective way to track infant immunizations.

Project Description
The system is designed to:

Register infants for their post-natal vaccinations
Schedule vaccinations for each infant
Digitalize traditional information and monitoring methods
Provide a centralized platform for tracking and monitoring infant immunizations
